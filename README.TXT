i want to make a story about organizem between 2 bilion years ago to half a bilion years 
you get to choose between 3 animals who lived 2 bilion years ago 3 shrroms  the same or three plants 

what would they be remember all 9 lived 2 bilion years

To create an imaginative story set between 2 billion and 500 million years ago, we need to focus on organisms that could plausibly have existed during those timeframes. Life was primarily microbial, as this period predates the emergence of complex multicellular organisms. Here’s a creative selection of organisms for your story:

Animals
While animals as we know them didn’t exist 2 billion years ago, we can use the concept of proto-animals or hypothetical ancient life forms:

Protozoans
Single-celled organisms with animal-like behavior, such as consuming other microorganisms. Imagine a protozoan capable of forming temporary colonies.

Ediacaran-like Creatures
Soft-bodied, multicellular organisms that resemble a precursor to animals, possibly filter-feeders or photosynthetic.

Hypothetical "Swimming Amoeboid"
A free-moving amoeba with flagella, possibly hunting other single-celled organisms.

Shrooms (Fungal-like organisms)
Fungi-like life forms could have existed as decomposers, even in such an ancient world:

Ancient Mycelial Network
A vast, underground network that connects the ecosystem, influencing nearby organisms.

Floating Spore Cloud
A fungal organism that releases bioluminescent spores into the water or air to spread its influence.

Towering Fungus Colony
Fungi that grow as spire-like structures, feeding on ancient organic matter.

Plants (Photosynthetic life forms)
Plant-like life would be represented by photosynthetic bacteria or early algae:

Stromatolite Builders
Cyanobacteria forming layered structures, creating oxygen and shaping the environment.

Kelp-like Algae
Large, multicellular algae that sway in ancient shallow seas, providing shelter for other organisms.

Sun-Trapping Mat
Flat mats of photosynthetic cells spreading across rocks, thriving on sunlight.

These nine organisms could form the basis of a vibrant ancient world where life is just beginning to shape the Earth as we know it. Would you like to expand on any of these for your story?

1.5 Billion Years Ago
During this time, life remained predominantly microbial, but new forms of complexity started emerging.

Animals
Crawling Amoeboids
Single-celled organisms that move across surfaces, consuming smaller microbes.

Filter-Feeding Aggregates
Colonies of single cells working together to filter nutrients from water.

Precursor to Jelly-like Organisms
Gelatinous blobs with basic mobility, possibly using water currents to move.

Shrooms (Fungal-like organisms)
Spiral Growth Fungi
Ancient fungal forms that grow in spirals, optimizing surface area for absorption.

Surface Decomposers
Fungi-like organisms breaking down organic detritus, paving the way for nutrient recycling.

Lichen Precursors
Symbiotic fungi paired with early algae, forming resilient growths on rocky surfaces.

Plants (Photosynthetic life forms)
Multicellular Cyanobacteria
Photosynthesizing organisms forming filamentous or mat-like colonies.

Early Seaweed
Simple multicellular algae growing in shallow marine environments.

Air Pocket Algae
Algae with tiny buoyant structures to keep them near the water’s surface for sunlight.

1 Billion Years Ago
Life at this point starts showing even more complexity, with multicellular organisms becoming more widespread.

Animals
Simple Sponges
Early filter-feeding multicellular organisms with basic body structures.

Tubular Organisms
Tube-like creatures anchored to the sea floor, possibly using water flow for feeding.

Pulsating Blobs
Simple pulsating organisms resembling jellyfish precursors, drifting in the ocean.

Shrooms (Fungal-like organisms)
Thread-like Mycelia
Extensive fungal networks breaking down minerals and organic matter.

Sticky Spore Spreaders
Fungi-like organisms that use adhesive spores to propagate on various surfaces.

Tree-Like Fungi
Primitive fungi forming stalk-like structures, reaching toward light or air for spore dispersal.

Plants (Photosynthetic life forms)
Early Macroalgae
Larger algae capable of forming dense underwater "forests."

Floating Green Mats
Surface-dwelling algae that dominate the oceans and contribute to oxygen production.

Filamentous Growths
Plants resembling long strands, possibly forming the basis for food chains.

500 Million Years Ago (0.5 Billion)
This is the Cambrian Period, where life diversified dramatically. True animals, fungi, and plants now thrive.

Animals
Arthropod Precursors
Small, exoskeleton-bearing creatures that scuttle along the sea floor.

Worm-like Organisms
Early segmented worms with burrowing abilities, transforming the seabed.

Ancient Predators
Small predators with primitive eyes and appendages for catching prey, such as early Anomalocaris-like organisms.

Shrooms (Fungal-like organisms)
Pillar Fungi
Large fungi forming stalks in damp environments, feeding on organic detritus.

Branching Mycelia
Fungi forming intricate networks, aiding other organisms by recycling nutrients.

Symbiotic Fungi
Early fungi forming mutualistic relationships with plants, possibly aiding in nutrient uptake.

Plants (Photosynthetic life forms)
Early Mosses
Simple moss-like plants growing along shorelines.

Vascular Plant Precursors
Plants developing basic vascular systems for transporting nutrients.

Seaweed Forests
Large underwater algae providing shelter for a growing diversity of marine life.

This progression illustrates the journey from simple life forms to more complex organisms, setting the stage for Earth's rich biosphere. Which of these creatures do you want to develop further for your story?
